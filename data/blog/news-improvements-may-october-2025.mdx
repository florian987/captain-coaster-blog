Welcome back, coaster fans! From backend improvements to brand‑new features and smarter tools for the community, here’s everything that landed on Captain Coaster between **May and October 2025**.

---

## May 2025

### 🔧 Mail DNS update

We switched our email service from **Mailjet** to **Amazon SES** to reduce operational costs and improve reliability.

## July 2025

### 🚀 Improved World Roller Coaster Rankings calculation

We refined the requirements for a Coaster to enter the **World Roller Coaster Rankings**:

- Minimum comparisons between Coaster A and Coaster B increased from **3 → 4**.
- Minimum total duels for a Coaster increased from **350 → 400**.
- Minimum duels for **elite Coasters** (score > 95%) increased from **600 → 650**.

👉 These adjustments led to a temporary removal of many Coasters from the Ranking — before they naturally returned once the new thresholds were met.

## October 2025

### 🚀 Captain's Review — New on Coaster Pages!

A brand‑new section now appears between Images and Ratings on Coaster pages: **Captain's Review**!

👉 This feature uses Amazon’s **Bedrock AI** to generate:

- A summary of user reviews (based on at least 20 reviews, up to 600 total), and
- Dynamic highlights of **pros** and **cons**.

Here is Captain's Review for [Ride to Happiness at Plopsaland Belgium](https://captaincoaster.com/en/coasters/3308/ride-to-happiness-plopsaland-de-panne):

![Captain's Review example](/static/images/news/captain-review.webp)

📝 **Note**: Currently available only in **English** and only for the **World Top 100 Coasters**, but it will gradually expand across the rest of the site.

### 🚀 New filters on the Ranking

You can now fine‑tune the Ranking view using three new filters:

- **Operating** – hide coasters currently not operating
- **Not ridden yet** – hide coasters you haven’t rated yet
- **New in Ranking** – hide coasters newly added to the monthly Ranking

📝 **Note**: These filters are **disabled by default**, giving you full control over how you explore the rankings.

### 🚀 Revamped Profile overview

Profile ovierview received a full redesign — clearer and more visual. Here's an example with my Profile:

![Profile overview](/static/images/news/profile-overview.jpg)

New improvements include:

- A distinction between coasters ridden in the **World Top 100** and those in the **World Top 100 operating coasters**. Here’s an example with someone who has ridden 82 coasters from the World Top 100 — including 80 that are currently operating:

- A brand‑new **Favorite Manufacturer** stat, determined by the manufacturer most represented in the ten first coasters of your personal Top Coasters.

### 🚀 Sign in & Register security improvements

We've added **email verification** and a **rate limiter** to login and signup to help reduce spam accounts and improve overall platform security.

### 🚀 Duplicate Image detection

To reduce redundant uploads, a **hash‑based check** now prevents Users from submitting duplicate Images.

### 🐛 Park page Links in Ratings lists

Links to Park pages in the Ratings and reviews lists were incorrectly pointing to a 404. This has now been corrected.

### 🐛 “Operating” filter on the Map

The **Operating** filter was disabled whenever no `parkslug` was present in the URL. It is now enabled by default, as intended.

### 🐛 Disabled Account Ratings no longer displayed

The homepage previously included Ratings and reviews from disabled Accounts — these are now fully excluded.

### 🐛 Missing watermarks

About **6,600 Images** slipped through watermark processing for Users who enabled it. These Images have now been properly regenerated.
