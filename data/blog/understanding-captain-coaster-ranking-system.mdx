# Understanding Captain Coaster's Ranking System

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how Captain Coaster determines which roller coasters are the best in the world? Unlike many other ranking systems that simply calculate an average score, Captain Coaster uses a sophisticated pairwise comparison system that more accurately reflects the collective preferences of the community. With nearly 2,000 coasters ranked (1,978 to be exact, with 29 newcomers just last month), our system has become the go-to resource for coaster enthusiasts. This article explains how our unique ranking system works and why it provides one of the most reliable roller coaster rankings available—no upside-down math required!

## The Basics: Pairwise Comparison

At its core, Captain Coaster's ranking is based on **pairwise comparisons**. Instead of just looking at individual ratings, the system compares coasters directly against each other. When you rate coasters or create a Top list, you're actually creating comparisons between coasters. For each pair of coasters you've rated, the system determines which one you prefer. These preferences are combined with those of other riders to determine which coaster wins each "duel." The results of all these duels determine the final ranking.

This approach is fundamentally different from a simple average rating system and offers several advantages that we'll explore throughout this article. Think of it as the difference between asking "How much did you enjoy this coaster on a scale of 1-5?" and "Would you rather ride Steel Vengeance or Fury 325?" The latter gives us much more useful information—and is probably the question you're actually asking your friends anyway!

## The Monthly Update Process

Captain Coaster's ranking is updated once per month, with changes taking effect at midnight (Central European Time) on the first day of each month. This monthly schedule allows for stability in the rankings while still incorporating new data regularly. During each update, all comparisons from user ratings and Top lists are processed, and the rankings are recalculated based on the latest data. This ensures that the rankings remain current while avoiding the confusion that might come from constant fluctuations.

Last month alone, we added over 16,100 new ratings to our system, bringing our total to 462,000 ratings! That's enough ratings that if you spent just 10 seconds reading each one, it would take you 53 days straight without sleeping to get through them all. Maybe stick to the rankings instead?

## How Your Ratings and Tops Create Comparisons

There are two ways you can influence the ranking:

### 1. Rating Coasters

When you give ratings to coasters, the system automatically creates comparisons between all pairs of coasters you've rated. If you rate Iron Gwazi higher than Zadra, it counts as a vote that Iron Gwazi is better than Zadra. If you give them the same rating, it counts as a tie. These comparisons are factored into the duels between coasters and help determine which coaster is preferred by the community.

Our community of over 14,000+ active voters has created a massive database of preferences. That's more people than you'd find in line for a popular coaster on a summer Saturday!

### 2. Creating a Top List

Your "Top Coasters" list (the one with a checkmark) provides even more precise comparisons and is the only top list that counts toward the world rankings. Each coaster in your Top is compared with every other coaster in your Top, and the position in your Top determines which coaster wins each comparison.

These comparisons from your Top list take precedence over your ratings if you've included the same coasters in both. This means your Top list has a stronger influence on the rankings than your individual ratings.

## The Mathematics of Comparisons

The number of comparisons grows exponentially with the number of coasters you rate:

- Rating 1 coaster: 0 comparisons
- Rating 10 coasters: 45 comparisons
- Rating 20 coasters: 190 comparisons
- Rating 50 coasters: 1,225 comparisons

This mathematical reality explains why experienced enthusiasts who have ridden and rated many coasters naturally have more influence on the ranking system. Each additional coaster you rate creates comparisons with all your previously rated coasters, exponentially increasing your contribution to the ranking.

## How Duels Determine the Ranking

For each coaster in the database, the system computes a "duel" with every other coaster. Think of it as a massive tournament where every coaster faces off against every other coaster. Our system has processed an astounding 77.2 million individual comparisons between coasters (with 2.4 million new comparisons added just last month)! Each of these comparisons represents a single instance where one rider expressed a preference between two coasters. That's more preference data than all sports fan polls in human history combined. Okay, I made that last part up, but you get the idea—it's A LOT.

Here's how it works:

1. A duel considers all riders who have experienced both coasters
2. Each rider's preference counts as a vote for one coaster or the other (or a tie)
3. The coaster with the majority of votes wins the duel

The final score of a coaster is essentially the percentage of its duels that it wins. A coaster with a score of 95 has won 95% of its duels against other coasters. This is why the ranking isn't always a perfect hierarchy where #1 beats #2, which beats #3, and so on.

In fact, the system can sometimes produce what's known as "Condorcet paradoxes," where coaster A beats coaster B, B beats C, but C beats A. This is a natural outcome of a pairwise comparison system and reflects the complex and sometimes contradictory preferences of the community. The final ranking resolves these paradoxes by looking at the overall percentage of duels won.

## Why This System Is Reliable

### 1. Quality Over Popularity

Unlike systems based on average ratings, our ranking is not influenced by the number of ratings a coaster receives. A rare coaster with few but enthusiastic riders can rank just as high as a popular one. The ranking reflects quality rather than popularity, allowing regional and lesser-known gems to shine alongside famous attractions. This creates a more diverse and interesting ranking that isn't dominated solely by the most visited parks and coasters.

### 2. A Single Opinion Cannot Disrupt

The pairwise comparison system makes it difficult for any single person to significantly impact the ranking. One person with an extreme opinion cannot dramatically change a coaster's position because the system relies on the collective wisdom of many riders. The more riders who have experienced both coasters, the more stable the comparison becomes. This built-in resistance to manipulation ensures that the rankings remain a reliable reflection of the community's preferences.

So no, that one enthusiast who thinks kiddie coasters are better than hyper coasters won't suddenly make Wacky Worm outrank Steel Vengeance. Sorry, Wacky Worm fans!

### 3. Experience Matters

The system naturally gives more weight to experienced enthusiasts. The more coasters you've ridden, the more comparisons you contribute, and therefore the more influence you have on the ranking. This encourages riders to experience more coasters and provide more data, which in turn improves the accuracy of the ranking. It's a virtuous cycle that rewards both the individual enthusiast and the community as a whole.

Think of it as nature's way of compensating you for all those hours spent in lines and all that money spent on park tickets!

## Behind the Scenes: Quality Controls

Here are some insights into how we ensure the ranking remains reliable:

The system implements several quality controls to maintain the integrity of the rankings:

1. Minimum comparison threshold: A certain number of comparisons between two coasters is required before their duel is counted. This ensures that rankings aren't determined by just one or two opinions. We need more data than "my cousin rode both and liked the blue one better."

2. Minimum duel requirement: A coaster must have enough valid duels with other coasters to be included in the ranking. This prevents coasters with too few comparisons from appearing in the rankings.

3. Higher standards for top-ranked coasters: Coasters with very high scores must meet even stricter requirements. This ensures that the elite coasters at the top of our rankings truly deserve their positions.

## Pro Tips!

### Maximize Your Influence

To maximize your influence on the ranking system, we recommend the following strategies:

1. **Rate every single coaster you've ridden**. Even your ratings for coasters you didn't enjoy contribute valuable comparisons to the system. Yes, even that painful SLC that rattled your brain—your suffering wasn't in vain if you rate it!

2. **Create a detailed Top list for your favorite coasters**. Focus on ordering your top X coasters (where X is a number you're comfortable with). You don't need to precisely order coasters you didn't enjoy—your ratings for those are sufficient. Nobody needs to know the exact ranking of which coaster hurt your neck more.

3. **Update your Top list regularly** as you ride new coasters that deserve a place among your favorites. Your opinions change over time, just like your tolerance for G-forces!

### Maintain Rating Consistency

While you're free to rate coasters however you wish, maintaining a consistent rating approach will make your contributions more valuable to the ranking system. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Use the same scale across all coaster types**. Avoid using different rating scales for different categories of coasters. For example, giving a family coaster 5 stars just because "it's good for what it is" creates inconsistent comparisons with thrill coasters. That's like saying "this grape is the best fruit ever" and "this watermelon is the best fruit ever"—they can't both be the best!

2. **Rate based on your personal enjoyment**, not on what you think others might enjoy or what's "objectively" good. We want your genuine opinion, not what you think will make you sound like a sophisticated enthusiast at meetups.

3. **Consider your entire rating scale**. If you save 5-star ratings only for the absolute best coasters in the world, you'll create more meaningful distinctions in your top tier. If everything is 5 stars, nothing is 5 stars!

## Conclusion

Captain Coaster's ranking system is designed to provide the most accurate reflection of the community's collective preferences. By using pairwise comparisons instead of simple averages, we create a ranking that values quality over popularity, gives appropriate weight to experienced enthusiasts, remains stable, and encourages riders to experience and rate more coasters.
