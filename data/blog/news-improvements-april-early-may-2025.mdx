Spring is in full swing, and so are the updates on Captain Coaster! We’ve rolled out some exciting new features, minor tweaks, and a couple of bug fixes to improve your experience. Let’s take a look at what’s new 👇

---

## April 2025

### 🚀 Custom display names are here!

This long-awaited feature has arrived: you can now **change your first and last name** as displayed on your profile — even if you use Google to sign in. More flexibility to show up how _you_ want!

👉 To do this, head to your **profile settings**, which now live on a [brand-new dedicated page](https://captaincoaster.com/en/profile/settings), accessible from the Profile menu:

📝 **Note**: the profile page URL has changed to [/profile](https://captaincoaster.com/en/profile).

### 🚀 Old park names now visible

Following the addition of former coaster names earlier in April, we’re now showing **former names of parks** too! These appear just below the current park name. For example, here’s **Holiday Park**, which used to be **Pfälzer Märchenpark**, and has recently become [Plopsaland Deutschland](https://captaincoaster.com/en/parks/21/plopsaland-deutschland):

🕵️‍♀️ These old names are also **searchable**! Here’s how it looks when searching for "Holiday Park":

### 🚀 Captain Coaster Blog now live!

As you can see, we’ve launched the **Captain Coaster Blog** 🎉
You can access it directly from the main site menu — a new space to share stories, updates, and insights from the coaster community!

### 🚀 Discord notifications for new reports

All new content reports now get posted to a dedicated **Discord channel**, helping the moderation team stay informed in real-time.

### 🐛 Missing Spanish translations

Several pages were missing **Spanish translations**, especially the [How does the ranking works?](https://captaincoaster.com/en/ranking/learn-more) and [Terms & Conditions](https://captaincoaster.com/en/terms-conditions) pages. These have now been fixed — and a few translation tweaks were made across other languages as well.

## May 2025

### 🚀 Search page now available!

You’ll now find a **“See all results”** link in quick search results!

![Search page input](/static/images/news/search-page-input.jpg)

Clicking it takes you to a [dedicated search results page](https://captaincoaster.com/en/search/) showing all matching **coasters, parks, and users** related to your query — a much easier way to explore everything connected to your search terms.

📝 **Note**: The old search page — the one that lets you find coasters near your location — has a new home: you’ll now find it at [/nearby](https://captaincoaster.com/en/nearby/).

That’s all for now — but we’ve got more in the pipeline, so stay tuned for upcoming features and improvements. Until then, happy riding! 🎢
